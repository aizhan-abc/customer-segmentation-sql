### SQL · Python · SQLite

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **SQL is used in real-world data science workflows** to analyze customer behavior and revenue performance for an e-commerce business.

The focus is on customer-level metrics that support business decision-making.

---

## Business Objectives
- Identify high-value customers  
- Measure customer purchase frequency  
- Calculate total revenue per customer  
- Compute average order value (AOV)  
- Rank customers by revenue contribution  

---

## Data Model
The analysis is based on a relational SQLite database consisting of:

- **customers** — customer information  
- **orders** — order-level data  
- **order_items** — product quantities per order  
- **products** — product pricing  

---

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Multi-table joins  
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`)  
- Calculated metrics (AOV)  
- `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`  
- Business-oriented query design  

---

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- SQLite  
- pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Key Output
A customer-level analytical table containing:
- total number of orders  
- total revenue  
- average order value  

This type of analysis is commonly used for **customer segmentation, revenue reporting, and KPI tracking**.
